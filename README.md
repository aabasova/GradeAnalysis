# GradeAnalysis
This repository contains a JAVAFX project for illustrating and analyzing academic grades. The data for the written exams are stored in a database. 
The project contains three main views.

## First view
The first view contains the progress of the academic degree. It contains a circle chart illustrating the completed ECTS. Additionally the current average grade and the best possible grade are computed. In case the student enters a target grade, then the system will compute the needed
average grade for the next exams.

## Second view
The second view illustrates the grades of the student for each semester. Additionally it computes the average grade for each semester. This view allows to add additional grades into the database after the name of the course (Module), the grade, the ECTS and the semester have been entered.

This view analyzes the grades of the student. The first chart illustrates the grade distribution of the student. The second chart illustrates the average grade per semester.
Further charts will be added in the near future.
